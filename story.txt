There once was a man from Peru, who dreamt he was eating his shoe. He awoke in the night with a terrible frieght to find that his dream had come true.
However, he discorvered later on that after his dream came to true, the only thing he can eat is the shoes. Whenever he eats anything else, his mouse will not be able to open no matter how hard he tries. He went to a lot of doctors but nobody was able to solve his problem. At this time, an old man who called himself a doctor appeared with a creepy smile.
